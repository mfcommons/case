   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND 
DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
   1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for 
use, reproduction,<br>
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 
of this document.<br>
<br>
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity 
authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting 
entity and all<br>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or 
are under common<br>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this 
definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to 
cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by 
contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) 
or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of 
such entity.<br>
<br>
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal 
Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for 
making modifications,<br>
      including but not limited to software source code, 
documentation<br>
      source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from 
mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, 
including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated 
documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in 
Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as 
indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to 
the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in 
Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or 
other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of 
authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to 
the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any 
modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by 
the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to 
submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this 
definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but 
not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source 
code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving 
the Work, but<br>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked 
or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not 
a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual 
or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by 
Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative 
Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object 
form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute 
copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with 
or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the 
Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text 
file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You 
distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided 
Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability 
to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose 
to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>
<br>

ANTLR:   The Program includes some or all of the following

following license: <br>
<br>
ANTLR 1989-2004 Developed by Terence Parr<br>
Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.
com<br>
<br>
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the 
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish 
with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by 
ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into 
commerical software.<br>
<br>
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, 
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By 
"credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source 
code into one of your programs (commercial product, research 
project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in 
the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR 
and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention 
that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the 
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these<br>
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this 
system and expect to make other tools available as they are 
completed.<br>

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http:
//fsf.org/><br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General 
Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed 
below.<br>
0. Additional Definitions.<br>
As used herein, â€œthis Licenseâ€� refers to version 3 of 
the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the â€œGNU GPLâ€� 
refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
â€œThe Libraryâ€� refers to a covered work governed by this 
License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined 
below.<br>
An â€œApplicationâ€� is any work that makes use of an 
interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based 
on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the 
Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the 
Library.<br>
A â€œCombined Workâ€� is a work produced by combining or 
linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of 
the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also 
called the â€œLinked Versionâ€�.<br>
The â€œMinimal Corresponding Sourceâ€� for a Combined Work 
means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding 
any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, 
considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the 
Linked Version.<br>
The â€œCorresponding Application Codeâ€� for a Combined 
Work means the object code and/or source code for the 
Application, including any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the 
System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of 
this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your 
modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by 
an Application that uses the facility (other than as an 
argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a 
copy of the modified version:<br>
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith 
effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply 
the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional 
permissions of this License applicable to that copy.<br>
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header 
Files.<br>
The object code form of an Application may incorporate 
material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may 
convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, 
if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical 
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, 
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you 
do both of the following:<br>
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License.<br>
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and 
this license document.<br>
4. Combined Works.<br>
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice 
that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of 
the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also 
do each of the following:<br>
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined 
Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its 
use are covered by this License.<br>
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL 
and this license document.<br>
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices 
during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library 
among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to 
the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
d) Do one of the following: <br>
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms 
of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a 
form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to 
recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the 
Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner 
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding 
Source.<br>
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run 
time a copy of the Library already present on the user's 
computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked 
Version.<br>
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would 
otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of 
the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is 
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined 
Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a 
modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the 
Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source 
and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you 
must provide the Installation Information in the manner 
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding 
Source.)<br>
5. Combined Libraries.<br>
You may place library facilities that are a work based on 
the Library side by side in a single library together with 
other library facilities that are not Applications and are not 
covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under 
terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that 
part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where 
to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 
versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library as you received it specifies that a certain 
numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License â€œor any 
later versionâ€� applies to it, you have the option of following 
the terms and conditions either of that published version or of 
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If 
the Library as you received it does not specify a version 
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose 
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever 
published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy 
can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of 
acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose 
that version for the Library.<br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>
<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it 
does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either 
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty 
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See 
the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free 
Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 
02111-1307 USA <br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" 
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the 
names:<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in 
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by 
James Random Hacker.<br>
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990<br>

ANTLR 2 License<br>
<br>
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the 
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish 
with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by 
ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into

<br>
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, 
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By 
"credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source 
code into one of your programs (commercial product, research 
project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in 
the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR 
and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention 
that you developed it using ANTLR. <br>
In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our 
source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to 
continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools 
available as they are completed.<br>

transformation or translation of a Source form, including 
but not <br>
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
and <br>
conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>

or Object <br>
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright <br>
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an 
example is <br>
provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the <br>
purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not 
include works <br>
that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by 
name) to the <br>
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
the <br>
original version of the Work and any modifications or

Contribution."<br>
<br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity <br>
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by

conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, <br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable <br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly <br>
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
Work and <br>
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a

by such <br>
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) <br>
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to <br>
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute 
patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>
is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>
the following conditions:<br>
<br>
     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative <br>
     Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices <br>
     stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works <br>
     that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, 
and <br>
     attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
     those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
     Works; and<br>
<br>
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its <br>
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that 
do not <br>
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one of <br>
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
     part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form 
or <br>
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if 
and <br>
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not <br>
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an <br>
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such <br>
     additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
     the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions.  
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>

License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>

     stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>

Derivative Works <br>
     that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, 
and <br>
     attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
     those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
     Works; and<br>
<br>
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part

do not <br>
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one of <br>
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
     part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form 
or <br>
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if 
and <br>
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not <br>
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an <br>
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such <br>
     additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
     the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for

Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions.  
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in

WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

The following will be added to the notices file for 
Shrinksafe (and called out <br>
in the DOU for Dojo):<br>
<br>
The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional 
Shrinksafe build <br>
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with 
that tool.  Shrinksafe <br>
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under 
Mozilla Public License <br>
Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has 
been made available at <br>
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.
org.  <br>
<br>
The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or 
higher in order to <br>
run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already 
approved for the Rhino <br>
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed 
with the Shrinksafe <br>
package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 
1.7r2.<br>

      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or

      represent, as a whole, an original work of 
authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship,

irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative 
Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object 
form.<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute 
copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with 
or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the 
Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text 
file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You 
distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided 
Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability 
to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose 
to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

<br>
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br>
<br>
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights 
granted under<br>
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be 
implied from the<br>
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this 
License.<br>
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is

    Version); or<br>
<br>
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in 
the absence of<br>
    its Contributions.<br>
<br>
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, 
service marks,<br>
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to 
comply with<br>
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br>
<br>
2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>
<br>
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your 
choice to<br>
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version 
of this<br>

Secondary License (if<br>
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br>
<br>
2.5. Representation<br>

<br>
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have

or other<br>
equivalents.<br>
<br>
2.7. Conditions<br>
<br>
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the 
licenses granted<br>
in Section 2.1.<br>
<br>
3. Responsibilities<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>
<br>
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, 
including any<br>
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, 
must be under<br>
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that 
the Source<br>
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms 
of this<br>
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. 
You may not<br>
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the 
Source Code<br>
Form.<br>
<br>
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>
<br>
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br>
<br>
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in 
Source Code<br>
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform 
recipients of<br>
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such 
Source Code<br>
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a 
charge no more<br>
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br>
<br>
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms 
of this<br>
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, 
provided that the<br>
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to 
limit or alter<br>
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under 
this License.<br>
<br>
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>
<br>
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of 
Your choice,<br>
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this 
License for<br>
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination 
of Covered<br>
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary 
Licenses, and the<br>
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary 
Licenses, this<br>
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered 
Software<br>
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the 
recipient of<br>
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute 
the Covered<br>
Software under the terms of either this License or such 
Secondary<br>
License(s).<br>
<br>
3.4. Notices<br>
<br>
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license 
notices<br>
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers 
of warranty,<br>
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source 
Code Form of<br>
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license 
notices to<br>
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>
<br>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support,<br>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
recipients of Covered<br>
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on<br>
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear that any<br>
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation 
is offered by<br>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every 
Contributor for any<br>
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include 
additional<br>
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability 
specific to any<br>
jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms 
of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software 
due to<br>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) 
comply with<br>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; 
and (b)<br>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such 
description must<br>
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of 
the Covered<br>
Software under this License. Except to the extent 
prohibited by statute<br>
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently 
detailed for a<br>
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate 
automatically<br>
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if 
You become<br>
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from 
a particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and 
until such<br>
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, 
and (b) on an<br>
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of 
the<br>
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after You have<br>
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a 
particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such 
Contributor<br>
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable 
means, this is the<br>
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with 
this License<br>
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 
days after<br>
Your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by 
asserting a patent<br>
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a 
Contributor Version<br>
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the 
rights granted to<br>
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software 
under Section<br>
2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br>
<br>
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 
above, all<br>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and 
resellers) which<br>
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under 
this License<br>
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>

that the       *<br>
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit 
for a        *<br>
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as 
to the     *<br>

You.        *<br>
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any 
respect, You     *<br>

servicing,   *<br>

constitutes an   *<br>

Software is   *<br>
*  authorized under this License except under this 
disclaimer.         *<br>
*

*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall 
any           *<br>

character      *<br>
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,

Some               *<br>

of           *<br>
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only 
in the<br>

<br>
10.1. New Versions<br>
<br>
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as

the license<br>
steward.<br>
<br>
10.3. Modified Versions<br>
<br>
If you create software not governed by this License, and 
you want to<br>
create a new license for such software, you may create and 
use a<br>
modified version of this License if you rename the license 
and remove<br>
any references to the name of the license steward (except 
to note that<br>
such modified license differs from this License).<br>
<br>
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible 
With Secondary<br>

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU 
General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies 
to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to 
use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully 
about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the 
explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software 
(and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code 
or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you 
can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must 
provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and 
recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you 
legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very 
clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the 
library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that 
the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that 
might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we 
insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library 
must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this 
license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered 
by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU 
Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit 
linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether 
statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally 
speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The 
ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The 
Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other 
code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary 
General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software 
developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These 
disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License 
for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages 
in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special 
need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs 
must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a 
free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library 
to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large 
body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C 
Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole 
GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux 
operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program 
that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal 
to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference 
between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the 
latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
<br>
          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright 
holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under 
the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this 
License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions 
and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work 
based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work 
under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, 
translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source 
code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The 
act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and 
output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a 
work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the 
Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with 
the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or 
any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the 
facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to 
ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such 
function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this 
function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  
If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But 
when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on 
the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other 
change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion 
or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to 
copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are 
not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion 
of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  
Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that 
uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this 
License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a 
library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by 
law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, 
data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small 
inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of 
the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, 
you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If 
the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must 
include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a 
reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you 
must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including 
whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, 
so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce 
a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is 
understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at 
run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the 
library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version 
is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a 
copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that 
uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special 
exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with 
the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the 
license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not 
normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means 
you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable 
that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such 
a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the 
work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms 
of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have 
received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These 
actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  
Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose 
any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you 
cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a 
patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the 
Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License 
would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have 
made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she 
is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If 
the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the 
terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not 
specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever 
published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible

authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting 
entity and all<br>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or 
are under common<br>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this 
definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to 
cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by 
contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) 
or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of 
such entity.<br>

Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>

indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in 
Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or 
other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of 
authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to 
the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any 
modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by 
the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to 
submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this 
definition, "submitted"<br>

      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the<br>

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not 
a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual 
or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by

<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative 
Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object 
form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute 
copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with 
or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the 
Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text 
file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You 
distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided 
Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability 
to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose 
to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>
<br>

erfunctory. Mostly we're concerned with things like what 
the added load <br>
on our servers might be. If the potential load is too large 
you might be <br>
asked to mirror the files on one of your servers and have 
your customers <br>
update via your mirror. If you want to disregard this 
request and launch <br>
your product without consulting us, please plan on your 
customers losing <br>
access to their updates fairly quickly. In short, it's a 
lot easier to be <br>
polite about this and contact us first. That way we can 
work with you to <br>
ensure you'll get the level of service you'll need without 
the risk and <br>
embarrassment of your customers being cut-off from 
receiving updates.<br>

BSD Protection License<br>
February 2002<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
--------<br>
<br>
The Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") license has 
proven very effective<br>
over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work 
throughout both<br>
commercial and non-commercial products.  For programmers 
whose primary<br>
intention is to improve the general quality of available 
software, it is<br>
arguable that there is no better license than the BSD 
license, as it<br>
permits improvements to be used wherever they will help, 
without idealogical<br>
or metallic constraint.<br>
<br>
This is of particular value to those who produce reference 
implementations<br>
of proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly 
illustrates that freely<br>
and universally available implementations leads the rapid 
acceptance of<br>
standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure 
standard (eg, OSI<br>
network models).<br>
<br>
With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the 
GNU General<br>
Public License, however, the continued success of this role 
is called into<br>
question.  Given that the inclusion of a few lines of "GPL-
tainted" work<br>
into a larger body of work will result in restricted 
distribution -- and<br>
given that further work will likely build upon the 
"tainted" portions,<br>
making them difficult to remove at a future date -- there 
are inevitable<br>
circumstances where authors would, in order to protect 
their goal of<br>
providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to 
guard against<br>
such "GPL-taint".<br>
<br>
In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate 
by producing and<br>
selling (possibly closed-source) code would wish to protect 
themselves<br>
against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.  While under 
existing<br>
licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any 
form of open<br>
license, if a license existed under which they could 
incorporate any<br>
improvements back into their own (commercial) products then 
they might be<br>
far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.<br>
<br>
For the above reasons, we put forth this "BSD Protection 
License": A<br>
license designed to retain the freedom granted by the BSD 
license to use<br>
licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both non-
commercial and<br>
commercial, while protecting the work from having future 
contributors<br>
restrict that freedom.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, 
and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
BSD PROTECTION LICENSE<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND 
MODIFICATION<br>

copyright notice; keep<br>
   intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of<br>
   any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this<br>
   License along with the Program.<br>
<br>

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and 
distribute<br>
   the resulting derivative works, provided that you meet 
the<br>
   following conditions:<br>
   a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program 
must be reproduced<br>
      and included in the source code, documentation, 
and/or other materials<br>
      provided in a manner in which such notices are 
normally distributed.<br>
   b) The derivative work must be clearly identified as 
such, in order that<br>
      it may not be confused with the original work.<br>
   c) The license under which the derivative work is 
distributed must<br>
      expressly prohibit the distribution of further 
derivative works.<br>
<br>
4. Modification and redistribution under open license.<br>

must be reproduced<br>
      and included in the source code, documentation, 
and/or other materials<br>
      provided in a manner in which such notices are 
normally distributed.<br>
   b) You must clearly indicate the nature and date of any 
changes made<br>
      to the Program.  The full details need not 
necessarily be included in<br>
      the individual modified files, provided that each 
modified file is<br>
      clearly marked as such and instructions are included 
on where the<br>
      full details of the modifications may be found.<br>
   c) You must cause any work that you distribute or 
publish, that in whole<br>
      or in part contains or is derived from the Program or 
any part<br>
      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to 
all third<br>
      parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
5. Implied acceptance.<br>
   You may not copy or distribute the Program or any 
derivative works except<br>
   as expressly provided under this license.  Consequently, 
any such action<br>
   will be taken as implied acceptance of the terms of this 
license.<br>
<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU 
General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies 
to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to 
use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully 
about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the 
explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software 
(and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code 
or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you 
can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must 
provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and 
recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you 
legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very 
clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the 
library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that 
the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that 
might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we 
insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library 
must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this 
license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered 
by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU 
Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit 
linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether 
statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally 
speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The 
ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The 
Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other 
code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary 
General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software 
developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These 
disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License 
for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages 
in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special 
need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs 
must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a 
free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library 
to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large 
body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C 
Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole 
GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux 
operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program 
that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal 
to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference 
between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the 
latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright 
holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under 
the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this 
License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions 
and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work 
based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work 
under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, 
translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source 
code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The 
act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and 
output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a 
work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the 
Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with 
the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or 
any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the 
facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to 
ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such 
function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this 
function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  
If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived<br>
 from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But 
when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on 
the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other 
change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion 
or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to 
copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are 
not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion 
of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  
Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that 
uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this 
License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a 
library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by 
law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, 
data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small 
inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of 
the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, 
you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If 
the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must 
include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a 
reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you 
must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including 
whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, 
so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce 
a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is 
understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at 
run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the 
library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version 
is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a 
copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that 
uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special 
exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with 
the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the 
license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not 
normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means 
you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable 
that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such 
a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the 
work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms 
of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have 
received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These 
actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  
Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose 
any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues),<br>
conditions are<br>
 imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you 
cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a 
patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the 
Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License 
would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have 
made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she 
is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If 
the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the 
terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not 
specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever 
published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible 
with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software 
which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for 
this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the 
free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting 
the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), 
EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
		     <br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of 
the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by 
permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to 
most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have 
at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is 
found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea 
of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General 
Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; 
either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied 
warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser 
General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the 
Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, 
MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the 
library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest 
in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by 
James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>

     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU 
General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies 
to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to 
use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully 
about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the 
explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software 
(and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code 
or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you 
can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must 
provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and 
recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you 
legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very 
clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the 
library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that 
the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that 
might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we 
insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library 
must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this 
license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered 
by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU 
Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit 
linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether 
statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally 
speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The 
ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The 
Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other 
code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary 
General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software 
developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These 
disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License 
for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages 
in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special 
need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs 
must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a 
free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library 
to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large 
body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C 
Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole 
GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux 
operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program 
that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal 
to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference 
between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the 
latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright 
holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under 
the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this 
License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions 
and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work 
based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work 
under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, 
translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source 
code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The 
act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and 
output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a 
work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the 
Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with 
the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or 
any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the 
facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to 
ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such 
function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this 
function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  
If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But 
when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on 
the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other 
change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion 
or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to 
copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are 
not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion 
of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  
Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that 
uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this 
License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a 
library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by 
law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, 
data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small 
inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of 
the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, 
you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If 
the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must 
include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a 
reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you 
must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including 
whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, 
so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce 
a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is 
understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at 
run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the 
library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version 
is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a 
copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that 
uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special 
exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with 
the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the 
license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not 
normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means 
you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable 
that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such 
a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the 
work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms 
of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have 
received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These 
actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  
Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose 
any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you 
cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a 
patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the 
Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License 
would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have 
made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she 
is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If 
the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the 
terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not 
specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever 
published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible 
with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software 
which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for 
this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the 
free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting 
the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), 
EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
		     <br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of 
the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by 
permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to 
most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have 
at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is 
found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea 
of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General 
Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; 
either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied 
warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser 
General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the 
Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, 
MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the 
library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest 
in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by 
James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990<br>

Contribution(s)<br>
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. 
If You<br>
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the 
Work<br>
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes 
direct<br>
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the<br>
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without<br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You<br>
meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices<br>
stating that You changed the files; and<br>

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute

within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed<br>
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; 
or,<br>
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents<br>
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, 
alongside<br>
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
the conditions stated in this License.<br>

otherwise,<br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work<br>
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede 
or modify<br>
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed<br>
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor,<br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the<br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or 
conditions<br>
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR 
A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any<br>
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under 
this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory,<br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly<br>
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, 
special,<br>
incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the<br>
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill,<br>
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and 
all<br>
other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer,<br>
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity,<br>
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this<br>
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may 
act only<br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on 
behalf<br>
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor 
by reason<br>
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is

document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users. <br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights. <br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library. <br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others. <br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license. <br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. <br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library. <br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. <br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system. <br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. <br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables. <br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) <br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does. <br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee. <br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library. <br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. <br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. <br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.) <br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these 
notices. <br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. <br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables. <br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law. <br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) <br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself. <br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. <br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.) <br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with. <br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution. <br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place. <br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. <br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute. <br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things: <br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above. <br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance. <br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. <br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library. <br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances. <br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License. <br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. <br>
NO WARRANTY <br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License). <br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>
< one line to give the library's name and an idea of what 
it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either 
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty 
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See 
the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free 
Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 
02111-1307 USA. <br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail. <br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" 
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the 
names: <br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

irrevocable  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made,  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in

or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product 
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>
<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it 
does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either 
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty 
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See 
the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free 
Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 
02111-1307 USA <br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" 
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the 
names:<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in 
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by 
James Random Hacker.<br>
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990<br>

perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those 
notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede 
or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product 
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on style 
sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM 
is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific 
dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of 
"use". See the older formulation for the policy prior to this 
date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about 
using materials from our site, such as the translating or 
annotating specifications. Other questions about this notice can be 
directed to site-policy@w3.org.<br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty- 
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>

copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly 
display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the 
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in 
source code and object code form.<br>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to 
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent 
license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the 
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the 
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination 
to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license 
shall not apply to any other combinations which include the 
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor 
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no 
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not 
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any 
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to 
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on 
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a 
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any 
other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, 
if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient 
to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to 
acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has 
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the 
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in 
object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: <br>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement; and<br>
b) its license agreement:<br>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all 
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties 
or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied 
warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose;<br>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all 
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, 
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this 
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other 
party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is 
available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain 
it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily 
used for software exchange. When the Program is made available 
in source code form:<br>
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy 
of the Program.<br>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices 
contained within the Program. <br>
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of 
its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows 
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. <br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. 
While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ('Commercial Contributor') hereby agrees to defend and 
indemnify every other Contributor ('Indemnified Contributor') against 
any losses, damages and costs (collectively 'Losses') arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third 
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by 
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in 
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to 
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged 
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified 
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in 
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to 
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the 
defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified 
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. <br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a 
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a 
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes 
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those 
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would 
have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to 
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires 
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. <br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE 
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is 
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated 
with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but 
not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs 
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of 
operations. <br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER 
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY 
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED 
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT 
LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY 
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br>
7. GENERAL<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or 
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and 
without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall 
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
provision valid and enforceable. <br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a 
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including 
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent 
licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this 
Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In 
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any 
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the 
Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's 
patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2 
(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. <br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate 
if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or 
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a 
reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. 
If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon 
as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations 
under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive. <br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this 
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is 
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The 
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions 
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one 
other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the 
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate 
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may 
always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of 
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute 
the Program (including its Contributions) under the new 
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, 
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property 
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by 
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not 
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. <br>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New 
York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of 
America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under 
this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action 
arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any 
resulting litigation. <br>

or Object <br>
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright <br>
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an 
example is <br>
provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the <br>
purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not

by such <br>
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) <br>
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to <br>
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute 
patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>
is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>

<br>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative <br>
 Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices <br>
 stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative

 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
 those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
 Works; and<br>
<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its <br>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not <br>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of <br>
 the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
 part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not <br>
 modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
 within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an <br>
 addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that 
such <br>
 additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
 the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for

reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
     3.1. Application of License.<br>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You 
contribute are<br>
     governed by the terms of this License, including 
without limitation<br>
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code 
may be<br>
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
future version<br>
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You 
must include a<br>
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source 
Code You<br>
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
any Source Code<br>
     version that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this<br>
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, 
You may include<br>
     an additional document offering the additional rights 
described in<br>
     Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You 
contribute must be<br>
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of 
this License<br>
     either on the same media as an Executable version or 
via an accepted<br>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom 
you made an<br>
     Executable version available; and if made available 
via Electronic<br>
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at 
least twelve (12)<br>
     months after the date it initially became available, 
or at least six<br>
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification<br>
     has been made available to such recipients. You are 
responsible for<br>
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains 
available even if the<br>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a 
third party.<br>
<br>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a<br>
     file documenting the changes You made to create that 
Covered Code and<br>
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent 
statement that<br>
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, 
from Original<br>
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including 
the name of the<br>
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in 
any notice in an<br>
     Executable version or related documentation in which 
You describe the<br>
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's<br>
          intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights<br>
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 
2.2,<br>
          Contributor must include a text file with the 
Source Code<br>
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the 
claim and the<br>
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that 
a recipient will<br>
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such 
knowledge after<br>
          the Modification is made available as described 
in Section 3.2,<br>
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file 
in all copies<br>
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall 
take other steps<br>
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups)<br>
          reasonably calculated to inform those who 
received the Covered<br>
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming<br>
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
licenses which<br>
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
Contributor must<br>
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>
<br>
               (c)    Representations.<br>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to<br>
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's<br>
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation
(s) and/or<br>
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the 
rights conveyed by<br>
          this License.<br>
<br>
     3.5. Required Notices.<br>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source<br>
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a 
particular Source<br>
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include 
such notice in a<br>
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user 
would be likely<br>
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more 
Modification(s)<br>
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice 
described in<br>
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in 
any documentation<br>
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' 
rights or ownership<br>
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to 
offer, and to<br>
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability<br>
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. 
However, You<br>
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf 
of the Initial<br>
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it 
absolutely clear than<br>
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is<br>
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial<br>
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the<br>
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty,<br>
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the<br>
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that 
Covered Code,<br>
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source 
Code version of<br>
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this 
License,<br>
     including a description of how and where You have 
fulfilled the<br>
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
conspicuously included<br>
     in any notice in an Executable version, related 
documentation or<br>
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights 
relating to the<br>
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered<br>
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your 
choice, which may<br>
     contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in<br>
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the 
license for the<br>
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter 
the recipient's<br>
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set 
forth in this<br>
     License. If You distribute the Executable version 
under a different<br>
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ<br>
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
Initial<br>
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the<br>
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by<br>
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result 
of any such<br>
     terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.7. Larger Works.<br>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code<br>
     not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger<br>
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must 
make sure the<br>
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the 
Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the 
terms of this<br>
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to<br>
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 
(a) comply with<br>
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent 
possible; and (b)<br>
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. 
Such description<br>
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in 
Section 3.4 and must<br>
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. 
Except to the<br>
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such 
description must be<br>
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to<br>
     understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
     This License applies to code to which the Initial 
Developer has<br>
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related 
Covered Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
     6.1. New Versions.<br>
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may 
publish revised<br>
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. 
Each version<br>
     will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the<br>
     License, You may always continue to use it under the 
terms of that<br>
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code 
under the terms<br>
     of any subsequent version of the License published by 
Netscape. No one<br>
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms 
applicable to<br>
     Covered Code created under this License.<br>
<br>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
     If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may<br>
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not 
already Covered Code<br>
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your 
license so that<br>
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", 
"Netscape",<br>
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not 
appear in your<br>
     license (except to note that your license differs from 
this License)<br>
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of 
the license<br>
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public 
License and<br>
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the 
Initial<br>
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice 
described in<br>
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be 
modifications of<br>
     this License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS 
IS" BASIS,<br>
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE 
IS FREE OF<br>
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING.<br>
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE COVERED CODE<br>
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS 
LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder 
will terminate<br>
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein 
and fail to cure<br>
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the 
breach. All<br>
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly 
granted shall<br>
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions 
which, by their<br>
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination 
of this License<br>
     shall survive.<br>
<br>
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement<br>
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against 
Initial Developer<br>
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom<br>
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  
alleging that:<br>
<br>
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly 
or indirectly<br>
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted 
by such<br>
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 
this License<br>
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate 
prospectively,<br>
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You 
either: (i)<br>
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually 
agreeable reasonable<br>
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications 
made by such<br>
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim 
with respect to<br>
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If 
within 60 days<br>
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not<br>
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the 
litigation claim<br>
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to 
You under<br>
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
expiration of<br>
     the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's<br>
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then<br>
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under 
Sections 2.1(b)<br>
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You 
first made, used,<br>
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by 
that<br>
     Participant.<br>
<br>
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant<br>
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version 
directly or<br>
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is 
resolved (such as<br>
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of 
patent<br>
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of 
the licenses<br>
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 
shall be taken<br>
     into account in determining the amount or value of any 
payment or<br>
     license.<br>
<br>
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 
or 8.2 above,<br>
     all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers)<br>
     which have been validly granted by You or any 
distributor hereunder<br>
     prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, 
WHETHER TORT<br>
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL 
YOU, THE INITIAL<br>
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR 
OF COVERED CODE,<br>
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO 
ANY PERSON FOR<br>
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR 
LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY 
AND ALL OTHER<br>
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN<br>
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF<br>
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY<br>
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW<br>
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE<br>
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO<br>
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term 
is defined in<br>
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial 
computer<br>
     software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation," as such<br>
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48<br>
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code 
with only those<br>
     rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
     This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning subject<br>
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is 
held to be<br>
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 
to the extent<br>
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall 
be governed by<br>
     California law provisions (except to the extent 
applicable law, if<br>
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-
law provisions.<br>
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party 
is a citizen of,<br>
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in 
the United<br>
     States of America, any litigation relating to this 
License shall be<br>
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of 
the Northern<br>
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa 
Clara County,<br>
     California, with the losing party responsible for 
costs, including<br>
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
attorneys' fees and<br>
     expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on<br>
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
expressly excluded.<br>
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language 
of a contract<br>
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply 
to this<br>
     License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, 
each party is<br>
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly 
or indirectly,<br>
     out of its utilization of rights under this License 
and You agree to<br>
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such<br>
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or<br>
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the 
Covered Code as<br>
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that 
the Initial<br>
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the 
Covered Code under<br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>
<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it 
does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either 
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty 
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See 
the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free 
Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 
02111-1307 USA <br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" 
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the 
names:<br>

claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do 
so.<br>

OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of 
any intellectual property or other rights that <br>
might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of 
the technology described in this document or <br>
the extent to which any license under such rights might or 
might not be available; neither does it represent <br>
that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. 
Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to <br>
rights in any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS 
Technical Committee can be found on the <br>
OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available

to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to 
obtain a general license or permission for the use <br>
of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS <br>
Standard, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. 
OASIS makes no representation that any <br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a 
host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". 
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment 
of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open
