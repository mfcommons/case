The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the 
Program.<br>
<br>
Limited use right<br>
<br>
As described in the International Program License Agreement 
("IPLA") and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited 
right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of 
Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource 
Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level 
of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of 
Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, 
or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other 
restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of 
the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of 
additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the 
Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to 
provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, 
or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the 
applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to 
use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee 
subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or 
supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make 
such additional rights available to Licensee.<br>
<br>
Specifications<br>
<br>
Program's specifications can be found in the collective 
Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's 
Announcement Letters.<br>
<br>
Prohibited Uses<br>
<br>

if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, 
or property or environmental damage.<br>
<br>
Multi-Product Install Image<br>
<br>
The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install 
image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program 
(and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a 
valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of 
the other software included in the image unless Licensee has 
acquired separate entitlements for that other software.<br>
<br>
Supporting Programs<br>
<br>
Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting 
Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use 
such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the 
Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support 
Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or 
otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program 
or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not 
be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be 
accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to 
Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, 
the terms in this License Information document supersede the 
Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient 
entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's 
installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate 
entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For 
example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value 
Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or 
a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or 
virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine,

be licensed. An Application is a uniquely named software 
program that is separately installable on a computing device. 
Licensee must obtain sufficient Application entitlements to cover 
all Applications that incorporate any portion of, connect to, 
or are managed by the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above, the following terms apply to 
Licensee's use of the Program.<br>
<br>

- Entitlement: Ratio 50 Thousand Monthly API Calls/1 
Application<br>
<br>
"Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') 
entitlements for the Supporting Program for every specified number ('m') 
entitlements of the Principal Program as a whole. Unless otherwise 
specified, the number of entitlements for the Supporting Program is 
rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 
100 PVUs for a Supporting Program for every 500 PVUs obtained 
of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of 
the Program, Licensee may install the Supporting Program and 
have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 
PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the 
total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program 
on account of the installation of the Supporting Program 
(although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such 
as the processor cores being made available to the Principal 
Program, as well).<br>
<br>
"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting 
Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. 
Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is 
authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting 
Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to 
perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as 
backup, recovery and authorized configuration.<br>
<br>
"Monthly API Calls" is a unit of measure by which the 
Supporting Program can be licensed. An API Call is the invocation of 
the Program via a programmable interface. Sufficient 
entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of API Calls 
in any calendar month.<br>
<br>
Mobile OS Platforms<br>
<br>
IBM has tested sample applications created with the mobile 
tools provided in the Program ("Mobile Tools") to determine if 
they will execute properly on certain versions of mobile 
operating system platforms from Apple (iOS), RIM (Blackberry), 
Microsoft (Windows, Windows RT, Windows Phone), and Google (Android) 
(collectively "Mobile OS Platforms"), however, Mobile OS Platforms are 
provided by third parties, are not under IBM's control and are 
subject to change without notice to IBM. As such, and 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, IBM does not warrant that any 
applications or other output created using the Mobile Tools will execute 
properly on, interoperate with or be compatible with any Mobile OS 
Platforms or mobile devices.<br>

if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, 
or property or environmental damage.<br>
<br>
Multi-Product Install Image<br>
<br>
The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install 
image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program 
(and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a 
valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of 
the other software included in the image unless Licensee has 
acquired separate entitlements for that other software.<br>
<br>
Supporting Programs<br>
<br>
Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting 
Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use 
such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the 
Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support 
Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or 
otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program 
or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not 
be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be 
accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to 
Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, 
the terms in this License Information document supersede the 
Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient 
entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's 
installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate 
entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For 
example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value 
Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or 
a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or 
virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine, 
Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the 
Program.<br>

Addressable Devices<br>
 <br>
"Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') 
entitlements for the Supporting Program for every specified number ('m') 
entitlements of the Principal Program as a whole. Unless otherwise 
specified, the number of entitlements for the Supporting Program is 
rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 
100 PVUs for a Supporting Program for every 500 PVUs obtained 
of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of 
the Program, Licensee may install the Supporting Program and 
have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 
PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the 
total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program 
on account of the installation of the Supporting Program 
(although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such 
as the processor cores being made available to the Principal 
Program, as well).<br>
<br>
"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting 
Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. 
Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is 
authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting 
Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to 
perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as 
backup, recovery and authorized configuration.<br>
<br>
"Monthly API Calls" is a unit of measure by which the 
Supporting Program can be licensed. An API Call is the invocation of 
the Program via a programmable interface. Sufficient 
entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of API Calls 
in any calendar month.<br>
<br>
Mobile OS Platforms<br>
<br>
IBM has tested sample applications created with the mobile 
tools provided in the Program ("Mobile Tools") to determine if 
they will execute properly on certain versions of mobile 
operating system platforms from Apple (iOS), RIM (Blackberry), 
Microsoft (Windows, Windows RT, Windows Phone), and Google (Android) 
(collectively "Mobile OS Platforms"), however, Mobile OS Platforms are 
provided by third parties, are not under IBM's control and are 
subject to change without notice to IBM. As such, and 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, IBM does not warrant that any 
applications or other output created using the Mobile Tools will execute 
properly on, interoperate with or be compatible with any Mobile OS 
Platforms or mobile devices.<br>

<br>
The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use 
of the Program.<br>
<br>
Virtual Processor Core<br>
<br>
Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the 
Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is 
comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities 
and that executes requested procedures, commands, or 
applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade 
enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each 
separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted 
device) that has the required components is considered itself a 
separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer 
created by partitioning the resources available to a physical 
Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a 
functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes 
instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction 
control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual 
Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by 
partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an 
unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each 
Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.<br>
<br>
For each physical Server, Licensee must have sufficient 
entitlements for the lesser of 1) the sum of all available Virtual 
Processor Cores on all Virtual Servers or 2) all available Processor 
Cores on the physical Server.<br>
<br>
In addition to the entitlements required for the Program 
directly, Licensee must obtain entitlements for this Program 
sufficient to cover the Virtual Processor Cores for the systems on 
which the resources managed or processed by the Program reside.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above, the following terms apply to 
Licensee's use of the Program.<br>
